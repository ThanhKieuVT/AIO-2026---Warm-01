# Chapter 4 – Machine Learning Courses for Beginners

For those who are looking for a course with a clear learning path, well-structured guidance, but do not know where to start and do not want to feel overwhelmed by a large amount of knowledge.

Here, we introduce **Machine Learning** courses suitable for beginners based on the following criteria:

- Easy-to-understand explanations with a clear roadmap  
- Hands-on practice that leads to real results  
- Large and active communities with good support

## 4.1. Machine Learning Specialization – Andrew Ng  
**(DeepLearning.AI / Coursera)**

This is almost the safest choice for anyone who is just starting to explore Machine Learning. This course series has been rebuilt and expanded into **three courses** (instead of the original single classic ML course), covering everything from fundamental concepts to important real-world topics.

It also includes many practical exercises, organized by sections and clear learning paths, helping learners understand the theory immediately after studying it.

Andrew Ng’s greatest strength is his teaching approach: helping beginners **understand the ML mindset first**, before moving on to code and algorithmic details. His explanations are clear, logical, and easy to follow.

This course is designed for:

- Learners who want to study ML in a solid and systematic way with a clear starting roadmap  
- Those who want to understand the core concepts and develop decision-making intuition  

**Note:**  To learn this course effectively, you should have basic knowledge of **Python**. Alternatively, you should plan to study Python in parallel so that you can complete the exercises more effectively.

## 4.2. Google Machine Learning Crash Course (MLCC) – *Free*

If you already have some basic Python knowledge and want to move fast, **MLCC** is an excellent choice. This is a fast-paced course that combines learning with hands-on practice, and it is easy to follow thanks to Google’s concise presentation of core concepts.

What makes MLCC different is that it focuses on **exactly what you need to get started**:

- Short, beginner-friendly reading materials  
- Short videos and interactive widgets (instead of text-only content)  
- Multiple-choice questions for self-assessment  

Notably, MLCC has received major content updates recently, providing a modern and up-to-date approach that keeps pace with current developments. The course is suitable for learners with basic Python knowledge and high-school-level mathematics. If you do not have these yet, do not worry—the course does not set high barriers, and Google provides a clear *“Prerequisites & prework”* section for beginners.

**Strengths:**

- Concise content with interactive exercises  
- Very effective for filling gaps in foundational knowledge

## 4.3. Kaggle Learn – Intro to Machine Learning (*Free*)

If you want the feeling of **being able to build something right after learning**, Kaggle Learn is a great option for beginners.

This is a **micro-course** format with short, easy-to-understand lessons that focus directly on key ideas and early practice. The course is designed to help you grasp core concepts and build your first model in a very short time  
(the suggested duration is about **3 hours**).

Kaggle also provides a clear follow-up learning path:

- **Intermediate Machine Learning** – common issues encountered in real projects  
- **Learn Pandas** – strengthening data manipulation skills  
- **Feature Engineering** – learning how to create better features to improve model performance  

This course is suitable for:

- Beginners who want to see results quickly  
- Learners who prefer short lessons with immediate practice instead of heavy theory  
- Those who want to become familiar with the ML workflow *(train → validate → improve)* before diving deeper  

Because Kaggle emphasizes rapid hands-on practice, it does **not focus heavily on foundational theory**. Therefore, we still strongly recommend combining it with the courses mentioned above to build a solid and well-rounded understanding.

## 4.4. Conclusion

In short, if you’re just getting started with Machine Learning, don’t try to learn everything at once. Pick one main learning path to build a solid foundation, and pair it with a hands-on course to sharpen your practical skills. You can begin quickly with **Kaggle Intro to ML**, accelerate your fundamentals with **Google MLCC**, and then build a strong, structured base with the **Machine Learning Specialization (Andrew Ng)**. Most importantly, as you learn each concept, try to turn it into a small project—don’t focus only on theory. That’s the fastest way to make real progress in ML.
