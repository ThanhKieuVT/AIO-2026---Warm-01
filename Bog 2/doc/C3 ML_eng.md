# 3. A Four-Step Roadmap for Beginners

For beginners, Machine Learning is often “mythologized” as a field dominated by advanced mathematics and complex algorithms. In reality, with the right approach and a well-structured learning path, it is entirely possible to build a solid foundation in a relatively short period of time. Below is a basic four-step roadmap that has been widely adopted by experts and training programs for those who are new to Machine Learning.

## 3.1. Building the Foundational Knowledge

Machine Learning cannot be separated from mathematics and programming. However, you do not need to become a mathematician—the key is to understand the underlying principles and how these concepts are applied in practice.

From a mathematical perspective, there are three core areas to focus on.
- Linear Algebra helps you understand how data is represented in the form of vectors and matrices, and how models “learn” through linear transformations.
- Calculus, particularly derivatives, plays a central role in optimizing loss functions during the training process.
- Probability and Statistics enable you to understand data behavior, probability distributions, expectation, variance, and how to evaluate the reliability and performance of a model.

From a programming perspective, Python is the most common and almost essential choice for beginners. You should be comfortable with basic syntax, data structures (such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples), functions, and loops. In addition, it is important to become familiar with foundational libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization.

## 3.2. Essential Introductory Algorithms

Before diving deeply into specific algorithms, learners need to understand how a Machine Learning problem is formulated. This includes distinguishing between supervised learning and unsupervised learning, understanding what input data (features) and output labels (labels) are, as well as the roles of the training set and test set. In addition, core concepts such as overfitting and underfitting are essential for evaluating and improving model performance.

Once this foundation is in place, you should begin with fundamental algorithms that are both easy to grasp and foundational for more advanced models later on.

- Linear Regression is the simplest yet one of the most important algorithms. It helps you understand how a model learns the relationship between input variables and output values by minimizing prediction error. Nearly all core Machine Learning concepts—from loss functions to gradient descent—can be clearly illustrated through linear regression.

- Logistic Regression, despite its name, is actually a classification algorithm. It serves as an ideal transition from predicting continuous values to solving binary classification problems, helping learners understand predictive probabilities and decision boundaries.

- Decision Trees provide an intuitive perspective on how models make decisions. This algorithm clarifies how data is split based on conditions and also serves as a foundation for more powerful models such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.

- K-Means Clustering represents the class of unsupervised learning algorithms. Through K-Means, you will learn how a model can automatically discover hidden structures within data without labeled outputs—a fundamentally different approach compared to supervised learning.
